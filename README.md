# Cuzi

Cuzi (chuzi) is a little, tiny HTTP web server implementation. I started to develop it with educational purpose. Currently I adding new features when I have time.

## Compile

You must have `gcc` and `make` to compile source code. You can install necessary tools under Debian based systems by typing:

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential
```

This command will install the `gcc` and `make` tools to your system.
On Arch based systems probably you have `make` and `gcc`. But if you don't, you can install by using `pacman`:

```bash
sudo pacman -S gcc base-devel make
```

If you are using Windows, you can use **MinGW** or similar tools.

> Sorry I don't use Windows for coding. So I don't know how to compile on it :(
